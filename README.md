## UberStrok
An effort to write a shitty UberStrike back-end implementation intended for educational purposes.

### Why
I've never written realtime servers for FPS before and to learn how to work with the Photon SDK. But
mostly to be able to play this game again with some friends for the sake of nostalgia.

And because [dropshot](https://www.github.com/festivaldev/dropshot) seem to be inactive, so I decided
to continue on my own.

### Building
Requires python for the post build events and things.

### Running
To run the thing you need stuff and things.

### 'Bugs'
Its not a bug, its a feature, but if you're not happy with it, you can still create a new issue 
about the feature, maybe I will polish it up. Or you could send a pull request with the polished feature.

If you managed to get it running even.
